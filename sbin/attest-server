"""
Quote and Eventlog validating Attestation Server.

This is a python flask server implementing a single API end-point on /, which
expects a POST request encoded in conventional form (multipart/form-data) that
includes a field called "quote" containing an input tarball (a source filename
attribute is expected). I.e. the encoded form should contain a section like;
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="quote"; filename="whatever"

To use from 'curl', you would;
  curl -X -POST -F quote=@"mytarball.tar" <URL>

The input tarball contains a TPM Endorsement Key, Attestation Key, Quote, PCR
list, Eventlog and other details. The API performs three actions:

* Validates that the Quote is signed by the AK
* Validates that the EK certificate has a good trust chain
* Validaets that the PCR extensions in the Eventlog produce the PCRs in the quote

It then invokes an external handler to verify that the eventlog
meets the policy requirements, and will return any output from this
handler to the attesting machine.
